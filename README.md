Hi! Welcome to my github! This page is deliberately simple :)

# Beliefs that drive my work
- Purposeful and strategic development is key for success.
- Being humble and admitting your mistakes is the only way to grow.
- Being pro-active instead of re-active makes the world a better place.
- Process without purpose is work without progress; work without process is work without purpose.
- Urgency should not be conflated with pace; it is important to move deliberately rather than hastily
- Form shapes function. Software is only as good as its codebase.
- Pure honesty is key to healthy communication.
- Trust but verify.
- Motion ≠ impact.
- Stability > Expansion.
- **less is more.**
